## Bureau of Labor Statistics

[This site](https://www.bls.gov/bls/proghome.htm) looks like a good home page
for all the data I'll need for this analysis.


* [QCEW - quarterly census of employment and wages](https://www.bls.gov/cew/#databases)
  * [And here are the downloadable files](https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm) which
  should work best for the data I need. I should also be able to find some of the
  data sets that I reference in my old code.
