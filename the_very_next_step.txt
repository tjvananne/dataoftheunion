1. data pipeline for "singlefile.csv" for a given year. this will be as detailed a file as we have. the absolute most granular. I'm thinking the argument should simply be a year. I intelligently build the web request from there to go pull the file (if I don't have it locally).

The unique key is:
# area_fips _ industry_code _ own_code _ year _ quarter

The key to join across years should be 
# area_fips _ industry_code _ own_code _ quarter
(year is the only thing missing from here)


I should be able to run my pipeline for 2016, then run my pipeline for 2017, and join the two together to see what the deltas are.
