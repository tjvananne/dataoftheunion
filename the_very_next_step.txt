I just completed a pipeline for county / state shapefiles

I want to now create a good pipeline (maybe function) to map 2012 NAICS industry codes to the new 2017 NAICS industry codes. The analysis will be off by quite a bit if this isn't done first.

I created many NA values during the mapping between 2012 and 2017 codes.
